# IOS Calculator built with React Native

This project is a simple iOS calculator built using React Native. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Developing this app helped me understand how to implement hooks and "Pressable buttons" in React Native.

## Features
- Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Clear button to reset the calculator
- Perform operations with rational numbers.
